# Project Name and Description

## Project Name

**RefractIQ**

## Project Description

**RefractIQ** is an IoT telemetry platform for refractometry instrumentation, providing real-time monitoring, alerting, and data visualization for refractive index measurements. The system enables Wi-Fi connected devices to reliably transmit readings with store-and-forward capabilities, while a web dashboard provides instant visibility into device status, target compliance, and alert conditions.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live device status and reading updates with 15-second auto-refresh
- **Target & Alert Management**: Configurable target RI values and alert boundaries with visual indicators
- **Store-and-Forward**: Devices queue readings during network outages and automatically flush on reconnect
- **Web Dashboard**: Modern Flutter-based interface with time-series charts and device management
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and Docker deployment

### Use Cases

- Quality control in manufacturing processes
- Laboratory instrumentation monitoring
- Remote device fleet management
- Process compliance tracking with automated alerts

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Flutter Web
- **Device**: C client with libcurl
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose, Cloudflare Tunnel ready
